# nuxt-demo-basic

This is a basic Nuxt demo starter that I (Tom Dale) uses when starting various projects. It has the imgix-vue SDK already started, a Navbar, and has several component templates that I often use already created.


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
